# Project 01 — Web Application Testing (Functional QA)

🌍 Language: English | [Português](README-PT.md)

---

## Overview

This project simulates a complete **manual QA cycle** for a web-based e-commerce application.  
The focus is on validating functional requirements, user workflows, and system behavior through structured testing practices.

The deliverables included in this project reflect real QA documentation used in professional environments, such as test planning, test execution, defect reporting, traceability, and final reporting.

---

## Project Objective

To validate the main functional workflows of an e-commerce platform, ensuring:

- Correct system behavior according to requirements
- Proper handling of user inputs (positive and negative scenarios)
- Identification and documentation of functional defects
- Traceability between requirements and test cases
- Clear reporting of testing outcomes

---

## Scope

### In Scope (Tested Features)

- User registration
- Login / Logout
- Product search and filtering
- Product details page
- Add to cart / remove from cart
- Checkout workflow (basic validation)
- Order confirmation flow

### Out of Scope

- Payment gateway integration testing (external services)
- Performance testing
- Security testing (penetration testing)
- Automation testing

---

## Test Types Performed

- Functional Testing
- UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
- Smoke Testing
- Regression Testing (basic scenarios)
- Exploratory Testing

## Testing Environment

- Platform: Web Application
- Browser: Google Chrome / Mozilla Firefox
- Test Data: Dummy test users and sample products
- Execution Type: Manual Testing

---

## Entry Criteria

- Test environment available and stable
- Requirements and workflow descriptions defined
- Test cases prepared and reviewed

---

## Exit Criteria

- All planned test cases executed
- All critical/high severity defects documented
- Test Summary Report completed

---

## Defect Documentation

Defects were reported using a structured format including:

- Title / Summary
- Preconditions
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected Result vs Actual Result
- Severity and Priority
- Evidence (screenshots/logs)

---

## Key QA Skills Demonstrated

- Test planning and scope definition
- Test case design (positive and negative scenarios)
- Workflow validation (UAT)
- Bug reporting with clear reproduction steps and evidence
- Traceability between requirements and tests
- Final reporting and test closure documentation
