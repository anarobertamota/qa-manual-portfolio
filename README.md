# QA Portfolio — Ana Roberta Mota

Welcome to my **QA Portfolio**.

I am an **ISTQB® CTFL-certified QA Tester** with solid experience in **functional testing (UAT)**, workflow validation, requirements analysis, defect reporting, and technical documentation in digital systems.

My background was built in structured information environments, where **accuracy, usability, traceability, and process consistency** were essential. I am currently focused on transitioning fully into **Software Quality Assurance (Manual QA)**.

This portfolio contains QA deliverables designed to reflect **real-world testing practices**, including **test plans, test cases, bug reports, traceability matrices, and test summary reports**.
